import { componentMapper, FormTemplate } from '@data-driven-forms/pf4-component-mapper';

const schema = {
  fields: [{
    component: componentTypes.TEXT_FIELD,
    name: 'name',
    label: 'Your name'
  }]
}

const Form = () => (
  <FormRenderer
    schema={schema}

### Development setup

Data Driven Forms is a monorepo which uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), so you can use all its commands as well.

1. Install

```console
yarn install
```

2. Build

```console
yarn build
```

3. Run a package

Each package has a small playground `package/demo`, where you can test your changes.

```console
cd packages/pf4-component-mapper
yarn start
```

4. How to clean?

```console
rm yarn.lock
yarn lerna clean # will delete all node_modules
```

All packages are linked together by default, so if you run a `yarn build` in a package, all other packages are updated to the latest version of that package.

#### Tests

Tests needed to be run from the core folder.

```console
yarn test

yarn test packages/pf3-component-mapper
```

#### Commits

Data Driven Forms uses [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer)

Format:

```
[type]([package]): message

fix(pf4): title accepts node
```

Types:
- `feat`: a new feature, will trigger new `_.X._` release
- `fix`: a fix, will trigger new `_._.X` release

Packages:
- Please describe which package is being changed `pf3`, `renderer`, ...

Please, do not use Semantic Release, if you update only the demo.

All packages are releasing together and they share the version number.

#### Changes to documentation

If your changes influence API or add new features, you should describe these new options in the `demo` repository. Thanks!
